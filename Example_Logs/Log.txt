DM: What is the premise of your adventure?

Player: I want to fight a dragon that is in the process of razing the walled town of Glastervoyle.

DM: You find yourself standing outside the gates of Glastervoyle, and you can see a large dragon looming in the distance. Flames are spreading wildly in the town
as the dragon incinerates everything in its path. The townsfolk are fleeing in terror, and the walls of the town are crumbling under the dragon's assault. The dra
gon itself appears to be a massive red-scaled beast with black horns and glowing yellow eyes.

What would you like to do?

Player: I pick up a bow from the nearby rampart and fire it at one of the dragon's yellow eyes as it passes.

DM: You quickly grab a bow from the rampart and notch an arrow to it. As the dragon swoops down, you aim at its glowing yellow eye and release the arrow. The arro
w flies true and strikes the dragon's eye, causing it to roar in pain and anger. The dragon notices you and turns its attention towards you.

Roll for initiative to see who acts first in combat.

Player: I roll an 18

DM: You acted quickly and manage to go first in the combat.

The dragon is currently hovering above the town, approximately 100 feet away from you. It appears to be relatively unharmed by your arrow attack, although it is i
n obvious pain.

What would you like to do on your turn? Note that you'd have to use a very strong or magical bow to have a chance to cause significant damage to the dragon with r
anged attacks.

Player: I want to search for a magical bow.

DM: As you look around for a magical bow, you notice a group of heavily armed guards barricading themselves inside of a nearby castle. They have a small stockpile
 of magical weapons, but they are struggling to fend off the dragon's attacks.

The guards are pleading for help, but they look like they will be overrun by the dragon very soon.

What would you like to do?

Player: I run down to the guards to assist and in the process search their stockpile for a bow.

DM: As you rush towards the castle, the guards see you coming and quickly open the gate to let you in. You can now see that the guards have a small stockpile of m
agical weapons, including bows.

The dragon is still outside, however, and it's just a matter of time before it breaches the gate.

What weapon would you like to grab and what would you like to do with it?

Player: I grab one of the magical bows, nock an arrow and fire it again at the dragon

DM: You grab a magical bow which can deal heavy damage to the dragon and quickly nock an arrow. The guards stand aside to let you take aim as the dragon continues
 to wreak havoc outside. As the dragon swoops around, you aim for its underbelly, which is briefly exposed.

Roll a d20 to make a ranged attack roll and add your Dexterity modifier, along with any relevant bonuses from the magical bow.

Player: I roll a base 18. I don't know my dexterity modifier or the bonuses for the bow. Can you add those for me?

DM: Great roll! Since you are using a magical bow, it likely has a bonus to the attack roll and damage dealt. Let's assume that this particular bow gives you a +3
 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

If you choose to attack the dragon's underbelly, your base attack roll of 18 with the added bonus of +3 results in a total attack roll of 21.

The arrow flies true and hits the dragon in its unprotected underbelly. You hear the dragon roar in agony as the arrow pierces its flesh and deals significant dam
age.

Roll 2d6 and add the +3 bonus from the magical bow to determine the damage you dealt to the dragon. This damage will be reduced somewhat by the dragon's armor, bu
t it still has an impactful effect.

Player: I roll 7+3 for a total of 10.

DM: Your arrow deals 10 damage to the dragon, which seems to have injured it further. The dragon screams in pain and fury and turns towards you.

It lashes out with its massive claws, attempting to strike you down. Please roll a Dexterity saving throw to see if you are able to dodge its attack. If you succe
ed, we can assume that you ducked out of the way of its claws. If you fail, you will take damage.

Player: Am I proficient in dexterity saving throws?

DM: Your character would have a proficiency bonus to their Dexterity saving throws if they have proficiency in Dexterity (which most classes like Rogue, Ranger, a
nd Fighter do). If you're not sure, we can assume you don't have proficiency unless you tell me otherwise.

Player: I am assuming I'm an elven archer like Legolas - i.e. a ranger.

DM: Great! As a ranger, you do have proficiency in Dexterity saving throws. Please roll a d20 and add your Dexterity modifier and your proficiency bonus to see if
 you can dodge the dragon's attack.

Player: I roll a 13. I'm assuming from a Human ranger character sheet I have access to that my modifier is 4. This is a total of 17.

DM: You quickly react to the dragon's attack and dodge out of the way, avoiding its deadly claw attack. Your Dexterity saving throw succeeds by a significant amou
nt, so you manage to avoid taking any damage.

The dragon is still hovering above you, and it appears to have taken significant damage from your arrow attack. What would you like to do on your next turn?

Player: I want the guards to assist. Can they enter initiative as well?

DM: Yes, the guards can join the battle on your side and enter initiative. They can aid you at the start of each of their turns by attacking, casting spells, or p
roviding you with assistance.

The guards have a lower initiative roll than you, so you will act before them. However, this might change if the dragon rolls a high initiative score.

What specifically would you like the guards to do to assist you in the battle?

Player: I would think the dragon will provoke opportunity attacks from everyone on each pass it makes until it lands. I want them to make sword and bow attacks ag
ainst the dragon every chance they get, including opportunity attacks.

DM: That's a good strategy! Each time the dragon swoops down, it will provoke opportunity attacks from you and the guards.

On your turn, you can continue to attack the dragon with your magical bow. Since the dragon is still hovering, you can fire at it again with advantage (meaning yo
u roll two d20s and choose the higher of the two rolls) because the dragon has not landed and is not taking the Dodge action to protect itself from your attacks.


Please roll a d20 twice and add your dexterity modifier and proficiency bonus, along with the +3 bonus from the magical bow, to both rolls. You can take the highe
r of the two rolls since you have advantage.

Player: Base 13. +1 for dex, +3 for bow and +3 for proficiency brings my total to 20 total.

DM: That's an excellent roll! The arrow hits the dragon again, and this time it lands in a joint between the dragon's scales. The dragon howls in agony as it take
s significant damage once again.

Roll 2d6 and add the +3 bonus from the magical bow to determine the damage you dealt to the dragon, which will be partially reduced by the dragon's armor.

Player: 8+3=11

DM: You deal 11 damage to the dragon with your arrow attack. The dragon is now starting to look visibly hurt and angered by your attacks.

The guards join in on the offensive as well, attacking the dragon every time it swoops past. They land several hits on the creature and you can see that the drago
n is bleeding from many wounds.

It's now the dragon's turn, and it makes another sweeping pass over your group. Everyone, including you and the guards, can make an opportunity attack against the
 dragon as it swoops past. Roll a d20 and add your Dexterity modifier and proficiency bonus to your attack roll. If you have a melee weapon, such as a sword, you
can use that instead of your bow if you prefer.

Player: The sword attack would make sense. I lift mine above my head with my free hand and attempt to rake the dragon's underbelly. The total of the roll+STR is 4


DM: Unfortunately, that attack misses as you swing too early, and the dragon is too far away for a sword attack to be effective.

The guards also try to land attacks with their melee weapons and bows, but most of them miss as well. It seems the dragon's speed and agility is making it hard to
 hit.

The dragon does not land a direct attack, but it does fill the area with flames, causing the castle to catch fire and threatening to trap you and the guards insid
e.

What do you do next?

Player: I want all of us to move into the courtyard for a better vantage point and to escape the burning castle. If more guards are present, can some of them figh
t the fire?

DM: You quickly think of a plan to move into the castle courtyard to avoid the flames so you and the guards can continue attacking the dragon with more visibility
.

The guards do have some means of fighting fires, but because of the size and intensity of the flames, it may take them some time and effort to try and fight back
the spreading inferno.

Moving into the castle courtyard will be a safer move for you all. It will also give you a better vantage point to re-engage the dragon. However, you need to be q
uick and coordinated, so you avoid getting caught in the burning castle.

You and the guards quickly make a dash to the castle courtyard, avoiding the flames as best you can. Once there, you can regroup and prepare to attack the dragon.


What would you like to do next?

Player: Another bow attack. I roll a 24 with modifiers.

DM: Wow, that's an incredible attack roll! You shoot your bow with a steady hand and a sharp eye, and the arrow flies straight towards the dragon. It pierces the
dragon's vulnerable stomach and the dragon lets out a horrific roar as it takes significant damage.

Roll 3d6 and add the +3 bonus from the magical bow to determine the damage you dealt to the dragon. Remember that this damage will be reduced somewhat by the drag
on's armor.

Player: Total of 14

DM: You dealt a heavy blow to the dragon, which now looks to be on its last legs. It struggles to stay airborne, but it still poses a threat to you and the guards
.

The dragon makes one last attack at you and the guards, but it misses all of its targets and crashes to the ground.

You and the guards emerge victorious, but the town of Glastervoyle is still in ruins.

What would you like to do next?

Player: I want to send two of the guards to douse the fire, and I and the remaining guard go to behead the dragon as a trophy.

DM: The remaining guards quickly get to work putting the fires out throughout the castle while you and the last guard approach the slain dragon.

As you approach it, you can see that the dragon's scales are still hot to the touch, and its eyes are dark and lifeless. Its body is enormous, and you can tell it
 would take a lot of effort to transport it back to town.

Roll a Nature or Survival check, whichever you are proficient in, to see if you can identify any valuable components on the dragon's remains, such as its scales,
teeth, or claws, that could be used to make items or sold for a profit.

Player: I am best at survival. With my +6 in survival, I roll an 8

DM: Unfortunately, you are unable to identify any valuable components on the dragon's remains. It may be worth bringing the dragon's body back to town for further
 inspection or to consult with a local expert.

You and the guard struggle to chop off the dragon's head, but with some effort, you manage to do so. The head is now a gruesome trophy that could be used to intim
idate or negotiate with others in the future.

What would you like to do now?

Player: Let's lug the dragon as-is head back to town, then clean and mount the skull above the city gates as a warning to others that may wish to harm us.

DM: You and the guards take a moment to catch your breath before setting to work transporting the slain dragon's body back to town. It's a laborious task, but wit
h the help of some rope and a cart, you manage to drag the dragon's body behind you.

As you enter the town, people are overjoyed to see that the dragon has been slain and give you a hero's welcome. You are hailed as a brave adventurer and showered
 with gifts and praise.

You and the guards eventually arrive at the city gates, where you mount the dragon's head above it as a warning to any future dragons who might think twice before
 attacking.

With your mission accomplished, you feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. You have saved Glastervoyle and become a local legend in the process.

Congratulations! And thank you for playing this adventure with me.
