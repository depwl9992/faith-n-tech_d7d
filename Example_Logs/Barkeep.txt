DM: What is the premise of your adventure?

Player: I am running a quick interaction with the local barkeeper.

DM: You find yourself in a cozy, bustling tavern. The air is thick with the smell of ale, and the sound of raucous laughter and clinking tankards fills your ears.
 You make your way to the bar, where a rotund, friendly-looking dwarf greets you warmly.

"What can I get for you, lass/lad?" he asks, polishing a mug with a cloth.

Player: I'm not one of those mamby pamby "non-binary" folks. I'm a rugged outdoorsman, and I'll have a full mug o' rum, thank ye kindly!

DM: The dwarf chuckles heartily. "Ah, I see you're a person who knows what they like! Coming right up." He pours you a full mug of thick, dark rum and slides it a
cross the counter towards you. "Be careful with this one, lad. It's strong enough to knock a bull over."

He eyes you up and down for a moment, as if sizing you up. "Say, you look like you might be handy with a sword. I heard rumors of a group of bandits lurking on th
e outskirts of town. If you're looking to lend some muscle in exchange for coin, I bet the local sheriff would be happy to pay for your services."

Player: Thanks for the tip! I'll look into it. But for now I'm just a wanderin' traveler looking for room. Does this fine establishment have any accomodations?

DM: "Aye, we have a few rooms upstairs available for rent," the dwarf replies. "They're not much, mind you, just a bed and a chamber pot, but it's a roof over you
r head, and we keep 'em clean."

He gives you a curious look. "You seem like an honest sort. I hope I'm not out of line for asking, but are you looking to stay for just one night, or are you plan
ning on sticking around for a while?"

Player: I'll be stayin' until I can find work. That sheriff's bandit-hunting job might prove useful, though, so let's make it for the night. Here, have some gold
for your trouble. [I hand over a few gold sovereigns, hoping it's enough]
