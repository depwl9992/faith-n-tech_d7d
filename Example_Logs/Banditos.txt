DM: What is the premise of your adventure?

Player: I am traveling solo on a highway fraught with banditos and want to make it to the next town with my life and possessions.

DM: As you traverse the dusty highway, you come across a small makeshift campsite blocking your path. The banditos laze around, their rifles slung lazily over the
ir shoulders as they eye you with keen interest. "Evenin' stranger," one of them begins, his thick accent unmistakable. "What's your business 'round these parts?
Got anythin' valuable? We could use some extra coin."

What do you want to do?

Player: "I don't gotta show you any stinkin' badges!" I yell, unholstering my own six-shooter as I begin firing.

DM: The banditos quickly scatter, some running for cover and others returning fire. You'll need to make a Dexterity saving throw to dodge their bullets.

Roll a d20 and add your Dexterity modifier. If the result is higher than 10, you'll successfully dodge the bullets and be able to continue down the road. If the r
esult is 10 or lower, you'll take some damage and have to decide whether to fight or try to flee once more.

Player: Natural 20, total 21

DM: With lightning-fast reflexes, you quickly weave and dodge around incoming bullets with ease. The banditos are surprised by your agility and precision, and eve
ntually, they give up trying to hit you and instead run for their lives.

You continue down the highway, making it safely into the next town without further incident. Well done! Is there anything you'd like to do in town once you've arr
ived?

Player: save and exit

DM: Okay, your progress has been saved. Have a great day!

Player: log and exit
