However, rumors have begun to spread that he has been possessed by a powerful demon. Thorne Darkwood, a half-elf ranger, has been tasked with investigating these rumors and preventing any harm that may come to the kingdom. Upon arriving in Eldrid, Thorne discovers that the king has indeed been possessed by a demon and has been slowly turning the kingdom's citizens into mindless slaves. \n\nThorne must navigate the castle's treacherous halls and fight off the possessed guards and citizens to reach the king and attempt to exorcise the demon. However, with each successful battle, the demon possessing the king grows stronger, and Thorne must uncover the source of the demon's power before it's too late. Along the way, Thorne encounters allies and enemies, including a charismatic bard who seems to know more than they let on and a mysterious elf who refuses to believe in the demon's existence. \n\nAs Thorne delves deeper into Eldrid's dark secrets, they realize that there is no easy way to save the kingdom from the demon's grasp. They must decide whether to risk everything to save the king and the people of Eldrid or abandon the mission altogether.
